PROFILE

Hey y'all!! I am a first year MURP dabbling in D&D and EAP. My origin story begins in LA, my parents met here and I was born here. However, we moved to the Bay Area when I was small and I was raised on the peninsula. Being raised close to the ocean/at sea-level, I recall being keenly aware of climate change and sea-level rise from a young age. I went to undergrad at UO in Eugene, OR where I was first introduced to urban planning and GIS. After graduation, I took a detour from urban planning and worked in the public health field where my passion for community engagement and healthy equity grew. I spent the last three years working for the CDC and living in Atlanta. I loved living in the south and miss a lot of things about it but I am happy to be back on the west coast. I am a leo and an older sister of three- I believe these are key parts of my identity and I love chatting about astrology! I also love spending time by the ocean/outdoors and reading. My favorite genre is suburban noir (think Gone Girl). I love learning about wildlife and native plants. I was an environmental educator in undergrad and I try to volunteer with the Friends of Ballona Wetlands as much as possible.

COURSE DESCRIPTION

I think this course is about learning how to harness large data sets to create informative maps that reveal urban planning issues. 

PROJECT IDEAS

I am really interested in the intersection of climate change, gender, and the built environment. I am interested in doing heat mapping of extreme heat events in Los Angeles to map out which communities are the most affected. I think pairing this with some sort of qualitative study about the people living in those communities would be interesting. I am also interested in mapping sea level rise effects on the CA coast and the Coastal Carolinas to reveal issues related to environmental justice. I am also interested in health equity and mapping how different communities are more/less resilient to COVID-19 and/or other communicable diseases. I am also interested in mapping how climate change will encourage the spread of disease in the years to come.

OBJECTIVES

- Gain more comfortability with large data sets. 
- Improve mapping skills. 
- Learn how to manipulate large data sets to create maps that visualize issues realted to health and environmental equity   and use them to hopefully inform policy change.
